# `perception_interfaces`

Provides a consistent interface for data generated by perception algorithms. 

The current state-of-the-art revolves around Deep Learning based algorithms like [YOLO],
[Deep SORT], [FairMOT], and [Re3], all of which deal with `BoundingBoxes`. So,
currently, the only message we have is that :smile:, but we can add more messages as
needed.
